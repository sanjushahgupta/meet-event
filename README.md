### Using Serverless Function

In this app, we will be using the API provided by google calendar to retrieve data about upcoming events. For that the app needs to be authorized. Here the serverless function is used for delivering authorization tokens to users which will be  hosted on AWS Lambda. The token generated by the authorization server will give the user the needed access to view event data from the Google Calendar API.
